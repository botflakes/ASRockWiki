# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.github_repo }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: r/ASRock Wiki
baseurl: "asrockwiki" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog

tagline: "An ASRock releated Wiki made by the ASRock Community for the ASRock Community"
description: "This is the r/ASRock Wiki - Here you will find a bunch of Guides and Tools. Including an FAQ, a Beta BIOS database and more!"
