These are our full comprehensive rules. If you're unsure why you might have been banned, read these. 

* **Everything must relate to ASRock**

* **Be civil and respectful**  
All posts and comments must be civil and respectful towards other users.

* **Avoid self-promotion**  
Repeated self-promotion of videos or websites is not allowed.

* **No politics- or religion-focused discussion**  
There are many forums and subreddits on the internet that are perfectly reasonable for political or religious discussion, but in an effort to avoid any arguments or emotions that go along with these topics, political and religious discussion is not allowed on r/ASRock.

* **No NSFW content is allowed**  
r/ASRock is a safe for work and family-friendly subreddit; NSFW content is not allowed in any form.

* **Flair posts accurately**  
For organizational purposes, there are several default flairs available. These flairs should be used for any new post made to the subreddit; if the default flairs are lacking, please contact the r/ASRock moderators to request new default flairs be added.
